# clh.lol source

A high-performance, visually immersive personal portfolio built with React 19, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project features advanced Framer Motion animations, scroll-linked effects, and a custom interactive design.

## Key Features & Recent Upgrades

- **Asymmetric Modern Layout:** Desktop view features a left-aligned hero section and a top-right floating navigation bar.
- **Advanced Page Transitions:** Snappy (`0.4s`) transitions using `AnimatePresence` with custom `cubic-bezier` easing, soft blurs, and scale effects.
- **Scroll-Linked Project Gallery:** Projects on the `/projects` page animate (scale, fade, blur) dynamically based on your scroll position and speed.
- **GitHub Activity:** A compact link to the author's GitHub profile.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for vertical (mobile) displays with centered layouts and auto-scaling typography.
- **Custom Interactive Cursor:** A spring-based circle cursor that reacts to clicks and hovers.
- **Integrated Blog:** A dedicated internal blog page for long-form updates.
- **Build-Time HTML:** Every public route is emitted as complete HTML for search engines, link previews, fast first rendering, and readers without JavaScript. React hydrates the same markup for the existing interactive experience.

## Documentation

- **Installation & Quick Start:** `docs/INSTALL.md`
- **Contributing Guidelines:** `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Architecture Overview:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Development

1. **Install:** `npm ci` (Node.js 20.19.0 or newer)
2. **Dev:** `npm run dev`
3. **Build:** `npm run build`

### Quality checks

- `npm run lint` checks JavaScript, TypeScript, React hooks, and Vite modules.
- `npm run type-check` runs TypeScript without emitting files.
- `npm test` runs the Vitest unit and component suite.
- `npm run test:e2e` builds the site and runs Playwright in desktop and mobile Chromium.
- `npm run check` runs linting, type checking, unit tests, and the production build.

Install the local Playwright browser once with `npm run test:e2e:install`.
GitHub Actions runs the complete check and browser suites on pushes and pull requests.

## License and reuse

The site code is [MIT licensed](LICENSE). Personal writing, project copy,
branding, and imagery are reserved; third-party fonts have their own OFL
licenses. See [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md) for the exact scope. Replace the
reserved content, `clh.lol` URLs, and Kit newsletter form ID before publishing
your own site from this source. The `private: true` package flag prevents
accidental npm publication; it does not limit the MIT license.

## Analytics

The production site is prepared for Cloudflare Web Analytics, which provides
aggregate traffic and performance metrics without analytics cookies or
cross-site tracking. For the Pages project, enable it under **Metrics → Web
Analytics**. Cloudflare injects the beacon on the next deployment; no analytics
token belongs in this repository.

## Newsletter confirmation

The signup forms post directly to Kit and don't treat a submitted form as a
confirmed subscription. In Kit form `9788220`, keep double opt-in enabled and
set **After confirming redirect to** to
`https://clh.lol/newsletter-confirmed`. On that page, readers can choose
**Hide signup prompts** after following Kit's confirmation link. This stores
only a local display preference, requires cookie consent, and does not claim
to verify or change the subscriber's Kit account. A direct route visit or form
submission does not set the preference.

### Static asset performance

Fonts are bundled as local Latin-subset WOFF2 files with their OFL licenses in
`src/assets/fonts`. The hero and body fonts are preloaded; optional font display
avoids a late font swap on slow connections. Screenshots use WebP and images
below the homepage hero load lazily. Blog listings ship metadata; article code
loads when opened, while the build still prerenders complete article HTML.

The service worker precaches the homepage shell and caches other pages and static
resources when visited. Previously visited pages work offline; unvisited pages
require a connection. Hashed build assets use immutable caching; public images
revalidate after one day, and the worker itself is never long-term cached.
