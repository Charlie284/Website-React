# Architecture Overview

**clh.lol** is a statically hosted React application built with Vite. Each public route is rendered to HTML during the production build, then React hydrates that HTML in the browser to provide client-side navigation and interactions.

## Core Modules

- **App.tsx** – Sets up `react-router-dom` routes and provides the global layout via `<Layout/>`. Browser builds load page components lazily; the build-time renderer supplies the same pages eagerly so their HTML is immediately available.
- **entry-server.tsx** – Build-only rendering entry point. It renders a requested route to a string and is not deployed as a server.
- **main.tsx** – Hydrates prerendered markup in production and falls back to a normal client render during development.
- **Layout.tsx** – Handles the background, mouse spotlight, responsive behavior, and global navigation and interaction wrappers.
- **Pages** – `Home`, `Projects`, `BlogPage`, `BlogPostPage`, etc. Each page is a functional component that composes reusable UI components and uses Framer Motion for entry/exit animations.
- **Components** – Re‑usable UI pieces:
  - `Nav` – Top‑right navigation with motion hover effects.
  - `Cursor` – Custom spring‑based cursor that disappears on touch devices.
  - `GitHubActivity` – Links to the author's GitHub profile.
  - `SharedCard` – Card UI for projects and blog cards with 3‑D tilt interaction.
- **Hooks & Utilities** – Mostly native React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useTransform`, `useMotionValue`). Small custom hooks handle prerendered navigation and preferences.
- **Tailwind Config (`tailwind.config.js`)** – Centralizes colours, fonts, and custom keyframe animations (e.g., background movement).
- **Content** – MDX files under `src/content/blog/` provide the blog posts, parsed by the custom `mdx` loader in `vite.config.ts`.

## Build & Deployment

- **Vite** compiles the browser application and a temporary build-time rendering entry point.
- `scripts/generate-static-metadata.mjs` renders all 29 application routes into `dist/`, injects route-specific metadata and structured data, generates `sitemap.xml`, and writes the top-level `404.html` used by static hosts.
- The temporary `.prerender/` bundle is deleted after generation. The deployed output is still only static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets; no Node.js or application server runs in production.
- React hydrates the generated HTML without replacing the page, preserving the existing animations, navigation, and route-level code splitting. The HTML also remains readable when JavaScript is unavailable.
- Asset handling is performed via Vite's built‑in static asset handling: any files in `public/` are copied as‑is to `dist/`.

### Extending the Architecture

If you add a backend (for example, for comments), mount an API under `/api/` and proxy it through Vite during development. Keep public content renderable at build time unless a feature genuinely requires runtime data.
